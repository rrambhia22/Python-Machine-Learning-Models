# Python-Machine-Learning-Models

Created a Python project for the dataset of Diabetes prediction using the various Machine learning models. 
The data analysis phases performed here were data collection, data description, descriptive analysis, data exploration (data visualization), data cleaning and model building.

Various models were build to check the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix which would classify the class into their respective classes.
